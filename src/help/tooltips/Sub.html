<h3>Subtracter:</h3>
<p>
A Subtracter has 2 inputs. One input is called<br>
"p" and the other is called the "m". The output<br>
is called "y".
<br><br>
Both "p" and "m" must be connected to signals with<br>
the same dimension. The dimension of output "y" is<br> 
the same as that of the inputs.
<br><br>
The output y is calculated as y = p - m.
