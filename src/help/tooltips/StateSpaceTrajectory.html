<h3>Trajectory in the State Space:</h3>
<p>
For 2nd order systems, this is simply the phase plane <br> 
portrait of the system. 
</p><br>
<p>
For higher order systems, "traj" will project the state<br> 
space trajectory to various two dimensional subspaces.<br>
For example, for a 3rd order system, there will be 3 <br>
phase plane portraits, from "x2-x1", "x3-x1", and "x3-x2"<br> 
subspaces.
