a simulation program for non-linear systems

This is a program that I designed and developed when I was teaching non-linear control systems to students in
Lanhzou Jiaotong University.

Initially I only intended to develop a very simple program so that students could use it to do some simple 
simulation. But when it got started, it became more and more complicated.

The end result was something like Matlab simulink, but I think it is easier to use :-)
